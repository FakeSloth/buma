# Getting Started

First, I want to setup the site to get it up and running. 
`server.js` will be the main file used for being the center of app. It 
will start the application, loading all dependencies and routes.

Next, I want to implement a authentication system which is login/signup. 
I will be using json web tokens for this. If you don't know what json web 
tokens are check out this [great article](jwt) about it.
