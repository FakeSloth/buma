## Initial Files

First, I want to setup the site to get it up and running. 
I used `git init` to start a git repository and `npm init` to create a 
`package.json` file.
`server.js` will be the main file used for being the center of app. It 
will start the application, loading all dependencies and routes. 
I also created a `config/config.js` file to hold all our configuration.
